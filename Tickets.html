  <h2>Paying a traffic expiation notice:</h2>

If you commit a traffic offence, you may be issued with an expiation notice and have to pay a fine.

Expiations can be issued for a variety of reasons. However, drivers are most likely to be issued one for a breach of traffic laws - eg a speeding offence.<br>
<h2>Paying traffic fines:</h2>

If you receive an expiation notice you can pay it:

    online at TSPOL e-pay
    at your local court or any Eseva customer service centre
    by phone on 100
    <br>

<h2>About traffic fines:</h2>

The expiation notice can either be a handwritten notice issued by a police officer or computer generated from a speed or red-light camera offence.

Expiation notices for speed or red-light cameras are posted to the registered owner of the offending vehicle. If the vehicle is registered in joint names, the expiation notice is forwarded to the person nominated as the contact owner or registered operator of the vehicle.

To contest the offence you may elect to have the matter heard in court.
  <br>

<h2>Expiation fees that apply to road traffic offences are set out in the:</h2>

    Road Traffic (Miscellaneous) Regulations [Schedule 9 - Expiation fees]
    Motor Vehicles Regulations 2010 [Schedule 5 - Expiation fees]
    Victims of Crime (Fund and Levy) Regulations 2003 [Schedule 1 - Victims of crime levy]
      <br>

Not the driver at the time of the offence
  <br>
If you were not the driver at the time of the offence, you may complete a statutory declaration nominating the driver - this is available from TS Police.
  <br>
An expiation notice will then be re-issued to the nominated driver.
  <br>
<h2>Overdue fines:</h2>

If you have an overdue traffic fine, you may have your driver's licence suspended.
  <br>
